    "description": "Silo Finance is a non-custodial lending protocol that creates permissionless and risk-isolated lending markets for all crypto assets, so you can borrow any token using another securely.\nSilo uses an isolated-pool approach where every token asset has its own lending market and is paired against the bridge assets ETH and USDC. Lenders in all protocols are only exposed to the risk of ETH and USDC at any given time. Since all tokens are paired with ETH or USDC, there is only a single market for every token asset, preventing fractured liquidity and allowing greater protocol efficiency.",
